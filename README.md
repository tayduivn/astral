## Thanks

I would like to thank my mother for keeping me company and encouraging me when I first started this project. Fred Chavez, Clifford Bailey, Prof. Chad Burrows, Prof. Matt Lyles, Killian Brooks, David Cantwell, Donald Hubbs, Daniel Kahn, Anjelicca Spruce, Hayley Howard and Desiree Bates helped me with ideas and reporting bugs. Last but not least, extended thanks to my best friend Dani, his sister Che, Chachis, Thomas, Mauri and their families for pretty much adopting me along with Choko, Diego and Javier for always treating me like family.
